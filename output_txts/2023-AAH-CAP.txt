 RE:  Department of Health Care Services Medical Audit     
 
 
Dear Mr. Golfin : 
 The Department of Health Care Services (DHCS), Audits and Investigations Division conducted an on-site Medical Audit of Alameda Alliance for Health , a Managed Care 
Plan (MCP), from April 17, 2023 through April 28, 2023.  The audit covered the period of 
April 1, 2022  through March 31, 2023.  
  
The items were evaluated and DHCS accepts the MCP’s submitted Corrective Action 
Plan (CAP). The CAP is hereby closed. The enclosed documents will serve as DHCS’ final response to the MCP’s CAP. Closure of this CAP does not halt any other processes in place between DHCS and the MCP regarding the deficiencies in the audit report or 
elsewhere, nor does it preclude the DHCS from taking additional actions it deems necessary regarding these deficiencies.  
 Please be advised that in accordance with Health & Safety Code Section 1380(h) and the Public Records Act, the final audit report and final CAP remediation document (final Attachment A) will be made available on the DHCS website and to the public upon request.  
  
If you have any questions, please reach out to CAP Compliance per sonnel.  
 Sincerely,  
 [Signature on file]

 MCPs are required to provide a C orrective Action Plan (C AP) and respond to all documented deficiencies  included in  the medical audit report within 30 calendar 
days unless an alternative timeframe is indicated in the CAP Request letter.  MCPs are required to submit the CAP in Word format , which will reduce the turnaround 
time for DHCS to complete its review. According to ADA requirements , the document should be at least 12 pt.  
 The CAP submission must include a written statement id entifying the deficiency and describing the plan of action taken to correct the deficiency, as well as the 
operational results of that action.  The MCP shall directly address each deficiency component by completing the following columns provided for MCP res ponse: 1. 
Finding  Number and Summary , 2. Action Taken, 3. Supporting  Documentation, and 4. Completion/Expected Completion Date. The MCP must  include a project 
timeline with milestones in a separate document for each finding. Supporting documentation should accompany each Action Taken. If supporting documentation 
is missing, the MCP submission will not be accepted.  For policies and other documentation tha t have been revised, please highlight the new relevant text and 
include additional details, such as the title of the document, page number, revision date, etc.,  in the column “Supporting Documentation” to assist DHCS in 
identifying any updates that were made by the plan. Implementing deficiencies requiring short -term corrective action  should be completed within 30 calendar 
days. For deficiencies that may be reasonably determined to require long-term corrective action for a period longer than 30 days to reme dy or operationalize 
completely , the MCP is to indicate that it has initiated remedial action and is on the way toward  achieving an acceptable level of compliance. In those instances, the 
MCP must include the date when full compliance will be completed in addition to the above steps.  Policies and procedures submitted during the CAP process must 
still be sent to the MCP’s Contract Manager for review and approval, as applicable , according to  existing requirements.  
 Please note that DHCS expects the plan to ta ke swift action to implement improvement interventions as proposed in the CAP; therefore, DHCS 
encourages all remediation efforts to be in place no later than month 6 of the CAP unless DHCS grants prior approval for an extended implementation 
effort . 
 DHCS will communicate closely with the MCP throughout the CAP process and provide technical assistance to confirm that the MCP offers sufficient documentation to correct deficiencies. Depending on the number  and complexity of deficiencies identified, DHCS may require the MCP to provide weekly updates.

1.5.1 Notice of Action Letters  
 The Plan did not ensure CHCN sent NOA letters to providers and members.  1. The Plan received CHCN's Root Cause 
Analysis (RCA) and CAP on 04/14/2023. After review and evaluation of CHCN’s document the Plan issued a formal CAP to CHCN on 05/31/2023 and received CHCN’s CAP re sponse on 06/27/2023.  
The initial corrective actions completed by CHCN includes updating their IT script and ensuring the identified missing NOA letters were sent out to the members.  Additionally, outreach was completed to confirm that services approved o r had 
denial modification authorizations were utilized by members. CHCN also developed workflows to detect and mitigate failures. The CAP includes CHCN's implementation of a remediation plan. The remediation plan includes updates in their workflow, trainin g, and an 
internal monthly audit - with results 
submitted to AAH for review. The Plan reviewed and evaluated CHCN's CAP implementation and progress during the 
interim and provided guidance. The CAP 1.5.1_AAH Response

finding:  
 
• CHCN Root Cause Analysis conducted by the delegate identified the root cause of the NOA failure is a system failure caused by an IT script update. This systemic failure went undetected due to lack of preventative and detective controls in place. The root cause for the fax failure is also caused by a system error.  CHCN updated their IT script and ensuring the identified missing NOA letters were sent out to the members.  
 DELEGATE CAP  
 • CHCN CAP and CAP Closure letter demonstrate the MCP required the delegate to complete CAP to address the issue of not sending NOA letters to its members.  The delegate updated the IT script to demonstrate all letters are generated daily and the missing member notification letters were sent on 4/12/23. Additional corrective action includes:

provided a verbal authorization due to 
a trip being of an urgent nature. The 
Plan hired two  transportation 
coordinators to focus on PCS 
acquisition leveraging the Plan’s 
preexisting relationships with the 
provider network and access to EHR’s. 
Through the end of 2022 and 
beginning of 2023, the Plan’s 
subcontractor, ModivCare, trained its 
call center agents on the new workflow.  
On 2/14/23,  the Plan trained its 
transportation coordinators on PCS 
acquisition.  
On 2/21/23, the Plan trained its entire 
case management team, that 
participates in phone shifts for the 
Plan’s case management phone line, on 
the parameters for verbal 
authorizations for NEMT trips of an 
urgent nature. The Plan continues to 
report on the success of the new

 MONITORING AND OVERSIGHT  
 
• Plan document “PCS Workflows” demonstrates the Plan created new workflows to verify the transportation broker is scheduling NEMT trips for members prior to receiving NEMT services. If no PCS form is on file, the trip is NOT scheduled until the PCS form is obtained. Once a complete/accurate PCS form  is received; the request will then be 
processed to schedule the member’s trip. (PCS Workflows) 
 
• Plan tracking “Sept, Oct, Nov_2023_PCS” demonstrates the Plan is tracking verified NEMT trips on a monthly basis. The tracker captures how many trips were requ ested; how many did not include a PCS 
form & how many trips were an urgent request. As of November 2023, the Plan has 68.66% of trips in PCS Compliance.

This report will assist in finding any gaps in PCS compliance.  The Plan estimates this report to go live 12/1/2023. (On Track)  • The training materials demonstrate that the Pla n’s staff received 
training on the proper PCS form process, including focusing on obtaining the PCS form before the trip takes place to verify the correct level of transportation is provided to members. (CM Rpt UMC9.23, slide 2)

4.1.1 Grievance Acknowledgement and Resolution Letter Timeframes  
 The Plan did not send acknowledgement and resolution letters within the required timeframes.  A grievance processing timeline was 
created to outline the grievance 30 calendar day process, day by day.    The timeline outlines that by day 5, acknowledgement letters will be sent out. We will continue to monitor the daily aging rep ort to 
ensure that acknowledgement letters are  sent in a timely manner.  
 The timeline also outlines that on Day 20, “If response is not received, after at least two  follow -up 
attempts, task to a Medical Director in Quality Suite.” Complying with this process will ensure that the 
Medical Director has sufficient time to reach out to the  provider or 
facility to assist in obtaining a response. The Grievance and Appeals staff  were trained on the 
new timeline on 08/01/2023, copies 
of the timeline were distributed to 4.1.1_Daily Report
