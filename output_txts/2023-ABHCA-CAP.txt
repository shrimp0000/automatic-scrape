 RE:  Department of Health Care Services Medical Audit     
 
 
Dear Ms. Chung:  
 The Department of Health Care Services (DHCS), Audits and Investigations Division conducted an on- site Medical Audit of Aetna Better Health of California, Inc. , a 
Managed Care Plan (MCP), from April 17, 2023 through April 27, 202 3.  The audit 
covered the period of April 1, 2022  through March 31, 2023 . 
  
The items were  evaluated and DHCS accepts the MCP’s submitted Corrective Action 
Plan (CAP). The CAP is hereby closed. The enclosed documents will serve as DHCS’ final response to the MCP’s CAP. Clo sure of this CAP does not halt any other 
processes in place between DHCS and the MCP regarding the deficiencies in the audit report or elsewhere, nor does it preclude the DHCS from taking additional actions it deems necessary regarding these deficiencies.  
 Please be advised that in accordance with Health & Safety Code Section 1380(h) and the Public Records Act, the final audit report and final CAP remediation document (final Attachment A) will be made available on the DHCS website and to the public upon request.  
  
If you have any questions, please reach out to CAP Compliance personnel.  
 Sincerely,

Corrective Action Plan  Response Form  
 
Plan :  Aetna Better Health of California             Review Period:  4/1/22 – 3/31/23  
 Audit  Type:  Medical Audit and State Supported Services                                  On -site Review:  4/17/23 – 4/28/23 
 
 
 MCP s are required to provide a CAP and respond to all documented deficiencies  included in the medical  audit report within 30 calendar days , unless an alternative 
timeframe is indicated in the CAP Request letter.  MCPs are requ ired to submit the CAP  in Word format that will reduce turnaround time for DHCS to complete its 
review.  According to ADA requirement, the document should be at least 12 pt.  
 The CAP submission must include a written statement identifying the deficiency and describing the plan of action taken to cor rect the deficiency, and the 
operational results of that action.  The MCP shall directly address each deficiency component by c ompleting the following columns provided for MCP response: 1. 
Finding Number and Summary , 2. Action Taken, 3. Implementation Documentation, and 4. Completion/Expected Completion Date. The MCP will be required to 
include project timeline with milestones in a separate document for each finding. Supporting documentation should accompany each Action Taken. If supporting documentation is missing, the MCP submission will not be accepted.  For policies and other documentation that have been revised, please highlight the new 
relevant text, and include additional detail such as title of the document, page number, revision date, etc. in the column “Supporting Documentation” to assist 
DHCS in identifying any updates that were made by the plan.   For deficiencies that require short -term corrective action, implementation should be completed within 
30 calendar days. For deficiencies that may be reasonably determined to require long- term corrective action for a period longer than 30 days to completely remedy 
or operationalize, the MCP is to indicate that it has initiated remedial action and is on the way towards achieving an accept able level of compliance.  In those 
instances, the MCP will be required in addition to the above steps, to include the date when full compliance will be achieved.   Policies and procedures submitted 
during the CAP process must still be sent to the MCP’s Contract Manager for review and approval, as applicable in accordance with exis ting requirements.  
 DHCS expects the Plan to take swift action to implement improvement interventions as proposed in the CAP by December 31, 2023,  due to the Plan's 
exit at the end of 2023.  
 DHCS will maintain close communication with the MCP throughout the CAP process and provide technical assistance to ensure the MCP provides sufficient documentation to correct deficiencies.  Depending on the volume and complexity of deficiencies identified, DHCS may require t he MCP to provide weekly updates, 
as applicabl e.

4.1.1 Billing Medi -
Cal Members  
 The Plan providers billed fully Medi- Cal 
eligible members for services which were covered under the contract.  
 In May of 2023, a  Balance 
Billing workgroup was launched by the plan to review and 
discuss all data related to 
balance billing. The group has  
continued to meet monthly and 
has developed a warning 
notification as a result . This 
notification outlines all the laws 
and codes prohibit ing providers 
from balance billing members.  
Whenever a balanced billing case is identified, t he provider  
will receive this letter. To 
further communicate with providers,  the plan has been 
using fax blasts to inform them 
of the balance billing issue. Notification s were sent  out on 
10/27/22, 1/9/23, 3/15/23 and 6/16/23.  Beginning in 11/2023, 
the plan will  begin 
implementing  the warning letter 
to providers . Additionally,  
providers fax blast were sent 
out on 10/26/2023 to inform them of the  upcoming  warning

4.1.2 Grievance 
Classification and Processing  
 The Plan did not properly classify and process members’ expressions of dissatisfaction as a grievance.  
 The plan has developed a 
Grievance Call Tracking Template to assist the Member 
Services Rep . with the 
grievance classification.  This 
template helps  in identifying 
when an inquiry should be classified as a grievance and 
when to submit t he information 
to the G&A Department.  This 
template  was put into action on 
5/5/23, and training was provided to all MSRs  on 
5/12/23. The team was trained again on 10/22/23.  1. Training deck

demonstrate the MCP  has conducted an audit on 
proper grievance classification to assess the effectiveness of its corrective action showing significant 
improvement .  (Documentation Call Tracking Audit

 The corrective action for finding 4.1.2 is accepted.  
 
4.1.3 Filing 
Grievance  
 The Plan did not implement and maintain a process to categorize a complaint as a grievance and not an inquiry when a member expressly declined to file a grievance.  
 The Member Grievances and 
Appeals Call Desktop has been updated to reflect that if a member declines to file a grievance, the call will be categorized as exempt.  The 
plan introduced an audit process in August 2022 to review call notes monthly to ensure accurate categorization.  
However, th e process  only 
included  a sample of call notes . 
 
The audit process has been 
enhanced to review  all closed 
calls not categorized as G&A.

Improvement Oversight  
 The Plan did not impose corrective action and financial sanctions on subcontractors upon discovery of noncompliance with Medi -Cal 
requirements.  
 The plan has been 
communicating  and educating 
the IPAs regarding balance billing  during the Joint 
Operations Meeting (JOM).  In 
collaboration with the G&A department, the plan has  
developed  warning letters to 
inform the IPA of  members who 
had filed a complaint  about 
being balance billed. These 
warning letters were sent to the IPA on 10/25/23.  Moving 
forward, the plan will continue to monitor the activity of balance billing alongside the 
G&A department to impose corrective actio n and financial 
sanctions if necessary.  1. JOM slide
