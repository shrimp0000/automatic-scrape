Anthem Blue Cross Partnership Plan, Inc. (Plan) is a subsidiary of Anthem, Inc. Anthem provides medical M anaged Care services to Medi -Cal beneficiaries under the provisions 
of the Welfare and Institutions Code, section 14087.3. It  is licensed in accordance with 
the provisions of the Knox -Keene Health Care Service Plan Act.  
 Anthem is a full -scope Managed Care plan serving the Medi -Cal, Medicare, and Seniors 
and Persons with Disabilities (SPD) population. The Plan delivers care to members under the Two- Plan, Geographic Managed Care (GMC), Commercial Plan, and Local 
Initiative models.   Mandatory enrollment of SPD into Managed Care began in June 2011. The California Department of Health Care Services (DHCS) received authorization (1115 Waiver) from the federal government to conduct mandatory enrollment of SPD into Managed Care to achieve care coordination, better manage chronic conditions, and improve health outcomes. In June 2011, DHCS awarded the Plan with the contract to provide Medicaid Managed Care benefits to beneficiaries under the State ’s SPD procurement.  
 On November 1, 2013, DHCS awarded the Plan the contract to prov ide Medicaid 
Managed Care benefits to beneficiaries under the State ’s Rural Expansion 
Procurement. The Plan is to deliver care to members in 18 additional counties under the GMC  rural model.  
 The Plan has five contracts to provide services in 27 counties: Contract 03- 76184,  a 
commercial contract, covers Alameda, Contra Costa, San Francisco, and Santa Clara Counties. Contract 04- 36068 is a local initiative contract cover ing Tulare County. 
Contract 07- 65845, a GMC contract, covers Sacramento County. Contract 10- 87049, a 
commercial contract, covers Fresno, Kings, and Madera Counties. Contract 13- 90159, a 
GMC and rural expansion contract, covers Alpine, Amador, Butte, Calaveras, Colusa, El Dorado, Glenn, Inyo, Mariposa, Mono, Nevada, Placer, Plumas, Sierra, Sutt er, Tehama, 
Tuolumne, and Yuba Counties.  
 As of November  2023 , the Plan served approximately 1,044,232 Medi -Cal members in 
the following counties: Alameda (87,775) , Alpine  (191) , Amador  (6,495) , Butte  (27,262) , 
Calaveras  (6,949) , Colusa  (5,550) , Contra Cos ta (37,118) , El Dorado  (15,809) , Fresno

This report presents the audit findings of the Department of Heal th Care Services  
(DHCS)  medical audit for the period of October 1, 2022 , through October 31, 2023 . The 
audit  was conducted from November 27, 2023 , through December 8, 2023 . The audit 
consisted of document review, verification studies, and interviews with the Plan representatives . 
 An Exit Conference with the Plan was held on April 12, 2024. The Plan was allowed 15 calendar days from the date of the Exit Conference to provide supplemental information addressing the audit report findings . On April 2 6, 2024,  the Plan submitted a response. 
The results of our evaluation of the Plan’s response are reflected in this report.  
 The audit evaluated six categories of performance: Utiliz ation Management  (UM) , Case  
Management and Coordination of Care, Access and Availability of Care, Member s’ 
Rights, Quality Management, and Administrative and Organizational Capacity.  
 The prior DHCS medical audit for the period of October 1, 2021,  through September 30, 
2022, was issued on June 19, 2023. This audit examined the Plan ’s compliance with its  
DHCS Contract and assessed implementation of its pending prior year’s Corrective  
Action Plan (CAP).  
 The summary of the findings by category follows:  
 Category 1 –  Utilization Management  
 The Plan is required to ensure that the UM  program includes an established specialty 
referral system to track and monitor referrals requiring prior authorization through the Plan. The Plan did not track or monitor referrals to in- network specialists.  
 The Plan is required to ensure decisions are made in a timely manner and are not unduly delayed for medical conditions requiring time sensitive services . The Plan did not 
ensure prior authorization decisions were made in a timely manner while awaiting the confirmation of California Children ’s Services (CCS)  eligibility.  
 The Plan is required to obtain written consent from the member when a provider files an appeal on behalf of the member. The Plan did not ensure the members ’ written 
consent was obtained when a provider filed  an appeal on the member s’ behalf.  
 The Plan is required to ensure that the Grievance and Appeal S ystem provides oral 
notice of the resolution of an expedited a ppeal within 72 hours. The Plan did not ensure 
the provision of oral notifications to members regarding the resolution of expedited 
appeals.  
   
 
 3 of 21 Category 2 –  Case Management and Coordination of Care 
 There were no findings in this category.  
 Category 3 –  Access and Availability of Care  
 The Plan is required to implement prompt investigation and corrective action when compliance monitoring discloses that the Plan ’s provider network is not sufficient to 
ensure timely access. The Plan did not ensure corrective actions were implemented for providers who did not comply with appointment wait time standards.  
 The Plan is required to provide member  appointment s with a Primary Care Provider 
(PCP) within 10 business days of the request  and a specialist within 15 business days 
of the request.  The Plan did not ensure that its providers offered member appointments 
with a PCP within 10 business days of the request  and a specialist within 15 business 
days of the request.  
 The Plan is required to use a DHCS -approved Physician Certification Statement (PCS)  
form on file to determine the appropriate level of service for Medi -Cal members.  The 
Plan did not ensure PCS forms were on file to authorize Non -Emergency Medical 
Transportation (NEMT)  services for all members.  
 Category 4 –  Member s’ Rights  
 The Plan is required to resolve grievances and send written resolutions to the member 
within 30 calendar days. The Plan did not send resolution letters for quality of service grievances within the required 30 calendar days.  
 The Plan is required to completely resolve member grievances.  The Plan sent member 
resolution letters without completely resolving the members ’ quality of service 
grievances.  
 The Plan is required to ensure timely resolution to the member as quickly as the member s’ health condition requires, within 30 calendar days from the date the Plan 
receives the grievance. The Plan did not resolve high severity quality of care grievances within 30 days of receipt of the grievance.  
 The Plan is required to ensure grievances related to medical quality  of care issues shall 
be referred to a Medical Director. The Plan did not refer all quality of care grievances to 
the Medical Director for resolution.

   COMPLIANCE AUDIT FINDINGS  
 
PLAN: Anthem Blue Cross Partnership Plan 
 
AUDIT PERIOD: October 1, 2022, through October 31, 2023 
DATE OF AUDIT: November 27, 2023, through December 8, 2023

CATEGORY 1 – UTILIZATION MANAGEMENT  
 
 
1.2  
PRIOR AUTHORIZATION REVIEW REQUIREMENTS  
 1.2.1  Referral Tracking for In- Network Providers  
 The Plan is responsible to ensure that the UM  program includes an established 
specialty referral system to track and monitor referrals requiring prior authorization through the Plan. (Contract, Exhibit A, Attach ment 5(1)(F))  
 The Plan shall ensure that policies and procedures for authorization decisions are 
based on the medical necessity of a requested health care service and are consistent  
with criteria or guidelines supported by  sound clinical  principles. (Cont ract, Exhibit A, 
Attachment 5(1)(J))  
 The Plan shall monitor, evaluate, and take effective action to address any needed improvements in the quality of care delivered by all providers  rendering services on its 
behalf, in any setting. (Contract, Exhibit A, Attachment 4(1))  
 The Plan’s, UM Program Description , lists the goals of the UM Program as “( 1) to 
ensure the adequacy of service availability and accessibility to eligible members; (2 ) to 
maximize appropriate medical and behavioral health care; and (3) to minimize/eliminate over- and/or under -utilization of medical and behavioral health services ”. 
 Finding: The Plan did not track or monitor referrals to in -network specialists.  
 Plan Policy, UMXX- 003 Access to Specialty Care (revised date 0 7/23/2023) , states , “No 
authorization is required by the Plan to see an in- network specialist .” If a member needs 
to see a specialist regarding their health, the PCP will refer the member to an in- network 
specialist. If the PCP cannot find an in- network specialist, they can reach out to the Plan 
for assistance.  
 During the interview, the Plan confirmed that because prior authorization is not required, 
they do not track referrals made to in- network specialists.  
 If the Plan does not track and monitor referrals to in- network specialists, it increases the 
risk of fraud, waste, and abuse. This could lead to a lack of access for members and 
ultimately result in substandard care and poor health outcomes.  
 Recommendation: Revise and implement policies and procedures to ensure referrals 
are appropriately tracked and monitored.

AUDIT PERIOD: October 1, 2022 , through October 31, 2023  
DATE OF AUDIT: November 27, 2023,  through December 8, 2023  
 
 8 of 21 1.2.2  Prior Authorization in Potential C alifornia Children’s Services  (CCS)  
Eligible Conditions  The Plan shall develop and implement written policies and procedures for identifying and referring children with CCS eligible conditions to the local CCS program. The 
policies and procedures shall ensure that the Plan continues to provide all m edically 
necessary covered services to the m ember until CCS  eligibility is confirmed. (Contract, 
Exhibit A, Attachment 11(9)(4))  
 The Plan shall ensure that its p rior authorization procedures meet the requirement that 
decisions are made in a timely manner and are not unduly delayed for medical conditions requiring time sensitive services. (Contract, Exhibit A, Attachment 5(2)(G))  
 Decisions to approve, modify, or deny, based on medical necessity shall be made in a timely fashion, not to exceed five business days from the Plan ’s receipt of the 
information reasonably necessary to make the determination. (Health and Safety Code,  
section 1367.01(h)(1) ) 
 Plan Policy , UMXX- 117 Decision and Notification Timeframes ( revised date 
07/26/2023) , states “the decision to approve, modify, or deny requested non- urgent pre-
service requests, are made within 5  business days from the receipt of the request, but 
no longer than 14 calendar days from the receipt of the request .” 
 Finding:  The Plan did not ensure pri or authorization decisions were made in a timely 
manner  while awaiting the confirmation of CCS eligibility.  
 Plan Policy , UMXX-004 CCS Referral and Coordination of Care ( revised date 
05/31/2023) , outlines the procedure to create a case, request further information, and 
“advise the requesting provider to defer the case to the member s’ county CCS office.”  
 During the interview, the Plan confirmed that the process is to advise the requesting provider  to refer to CCS. If CCS does not accept the member, the Plan will furnish 
medically necessary services.   A verification study revealed that in all three requests for prior authorization, the Plan delayed evaluation until CCS eligibility was denied as fol lows:  
• One case involved evaluation by a hematologist -oncologist (cancer doctor) of a 
chest mass in a five- year-old with a family history of neurologic tumors. The Plan 
deferred decision making for 21 days.  
• Another case involved testing for unexplained syncope (loss of consciousness) in a 16- year-old where the Plan deferred decision making for 29 days.  
• In the last case, involving a hospital stay, the Plan deferred decision making for 34 days.

AUDIT PERIOD: October 1, 2022 , through October 31, 2023  
DATE OF AUDIT: November 27, 2023,  through December 8, 2023  
 
 9 of 21 For these cases, the Plan did not document any other reason for delay, such as the need for further information.  
 The Plan’s procedures do not require the Plan to provide medically necessary services 
until CCS eligibility is confirmed.  
 If requested services are not det ermined in a timely fashion, this may delay the 
provision of medically necessary care and ultimately result in poor health outcomes.  
 Recommendation: Develop policies and procedures to ensure prior authorization 
decisions are made in a timely manner for the provision of medically necessary services 
and not unduly delayed for the confirmation of CCS eligibility.

1.3  
PRIOR AUTHORIZATION APPEAL PROCESS  
 
1.3.1  Written Consent for Appeals Made on Behalf of a Member  
 The member, or a p rovider acting on behalf of a m ember and with the m ember ’ 
S’ written consent, may request an a ppeal. (Contract, Exhibit A, Attachment 14 (5)(A))  
 Appeals filed by the provider on behalf of the member require written consent from the member. (All Plan Letter (APL) 21 -011, Grievance and Appeal Requirements)  
 Plan Policy , GAMC -051 Member Appeals  (revised date 05/17/2023) , states “Appeals 
filed by the provider on behalf of the beneficiary require written consent from the beneficiary. The Plan will send an acknowledgment letter to the member, which includes a consent form, and request the member submit their written consent .” 
 Finding: The  Plan did not  ensure  the members ’ written  consent  was obtained when a 
provider  filed an appeal on the member s’ behalf.  
 A verification study of provider -initiated appeals revealed that five out of eight appeals 
did not have the member s’ written consent.  
 During the interview, the Plan confirmed that although it sends a consent form along with the appeal acknowledgment letter to the member, it  lacks a process to ensure that 
the member s’ written consent is sent back to the Plan.  
The written consent to a provider -initiated appeal furnishes members with necessary 
information about their medical care needs. Without this written consent, members are not able to provide input into their own healthcare decisions.   
Recommendation:  Revise and implement policies and procedures to ensure a 
member s’ written  consent is obtained when a provider requests an appeal on behalf of a 
member.   
  1.3.2  Oral Notification of Resolution for Expedited Appeals 
 The Plan shall ensure that the Grievance and Appeal S ystem provides oral notice of the 
resolution of an expedited a ppeal within 72 hours. (Contract, Exhibit A, Attachment 
14(1)(H))  
 The Plans are required to make reasonable efforts to provide the member with oral notice of the expedited appeal resolution. ( APL 21-011, Grievance and Appeal 
Requirements)  
   COMPLIANCE AUDIT FINDINGS  
 
PLAN: Anthem Blue Cross Partnership Plan 
 
AUDIT PERIOD: October 1, 2022, through October 31, 2023 
DATE OF AUDIT: November 27, 2023, through December 8, 2023 
 
 11 of 21  Plan Policy , GAMC -051 Member Appeals (revised date 0 5/17/2023) , states that the 
Plan makes reasonable efforts to provide oral notices to members of expedited appeal resolutions. In addition, the Plan also utilizes an a ppeals checklist with instructions for 
the Grievance and Appeal associate to “ review that one oral attempt was made to notify 
the member of the resolution, and there is a documented note in the case.” 
 Finding: The Plan did not ensure the provision of oral notifications to members 
regarding the resolution of expedited appeals.  
 A verification study showed two  out of six expedited appeals did not have a documented 
attempt to provide oral notification to the member.  
 During the interview, the Plan stated that for expedited appeal resolutions, if a call is made to the member the attempt is documented in the chart. For some members, like in-patient members, a call may not be made.  
 
Because expedited appeals involve decisions that could seriously jeopardize the 
member s’ health, it is imperative to provide the decision as soon as poss ible. In 
addition, when the Plan does not notify the member, it may affect the quality of their care.  
 Recommendation: Fully implement policies and procedures to ensure that a 
reasonable attempt is made to provide oral notice to members regarding expedited appeal resolutions.

CATEGORY 3 – ACCESS AND AVAILABILITY OF CARE  
 
 
3.1  
ACCESS AND AVAILABILITY OF CARE  
 
 
3.1.1 Corrective Actions for Timely Access Deficiencies 
The Plan is required to establish acceptable accessibility standards in accordance with California Code of Regulations (CCR), Title 28, section 1300.67.2. The Plan shall communicate, enforce, and monitor providers ’ compliance with access standards. 
(Contract, Exhibit A, Attachment 9(3)(C))  
 The Plan is required to implement prompt investigation and corrective action when compliance monitoring discloses that the Plan ’s provider network is not sufficient to 
ensure timely access, which includes but is not limited to taking all necessary and appropriate action to identify the causes underlying identified timely access deficiencies 
and to bring its network into compliance. (CCR, Title 28,  section 1300.67.2.2 (d)(3))  
 Plan Policy , CA_PNXX_033 Access to Care Standards  – CA (revised date 0 4/28/2023) , 
indicated that  provider CAPs : providers who are found to be out of compliance will be 
required to submit a CAP to the Plan for monitoring.  
 Finding:  The Plan did not ensure that corrective actions were implemented for 
providers who did not comply with appointment wait time standards.  
A verification study of 19 CAPs  (Corrective Action Plan) , based on the 2022 Provider 
Appointment Availability Survey (P AAS) , showed that the Plan lacked an effective 
process to monitor for CAP implementation to meet access standards. It was noted that the Plan provided network notification and correspondence informing a provider group of individual providers who were non-compliant with access standards. In response, the provider group sent the Plan a CAP response letter. However, the provider group did not identify the individual non- compliant providers, the nature of each provider ’s non-
compliance, and the specific corrective actions that were implemented at the provider level. Therefore, the Plan could not monitor and ascertain CAP implementation and compliance with access standards.  
During  the interview, the Plan stated that it required non- compliant providers,  who did 
not meet the access timeframe requirements in the PAAS survey  to submit a CAP to the 
Plan. However, the Plan confirmed they did not determine if any  corrective actions at 
the provider level were submitted or implemented as specified in Plan Policy , 
CA_PNXX_033.

DATE OF AUDIT: November 27, 2023, through December 8, 2023 
 
 13 of 21 Without implementing corrective actions for non- compliant providers, the Plan will 
continue to experience non- compliance with appointment wait times that could result in 
members not receiving timely care access.  
 Recommendation:  Revise and carry out policies and procedures to ensure the Plan 
implements corrective actions for providers who do not comply with appointment wait time standards.  
  3.1.2 Appointment Waits Time Grievances Monitoring  
 The Plan shall ensure the provision of acceptable accessibility standards in accordance with CCR, Title 28, section 1300.67.2.2 as specified: m embers must be offered an 
appointment with a PCP within ten business days of the request  and a specialist within 
15 business days  of the request. (Contract, Exhibit A, Attachment 9( 3)) 
 Each health care service plan shall have a documented system for monitoring and evaluating the accessibility of care, including a system for addressing problems that develop, which shall include, but is not limited to, waiting time and appointments. ( CCR, 
Title 28, section 1300.67.2(f))  
 Plan Policy , CA_PNXX_033 Access to Care Standards – CA (revised date 0 4/28/2023) 
indicated that all contracted providers must not exceed the specified intervals between a member s’ request for service and the date/time an appointment is offered for the 
member to receive requested medical services  (PCP within 10 business days of the 
request , and a specialist within 15 business days of the request ). 
 Finding: The Plan did not ensure that its providers offered member appointments with a 
PCP (Primary Care Physician) within ten business days of the request,  and a specialist 
within 15 business days of the request.  
 A verification study of access -related grievances showed that for six of nine cases, the 
Plan did not offer a PCP appointment within the required 10 business days, or a 
specialist appointment within the required 15 days . For example:  
• On 10/24/ 2022, a membe r filed a grievance stating that a PCP did not have 
an appointment until January 2023. The Plan confirmed with the PCP office 
that they don ’t have available appointments until January 2023. On 
11/23/2022, the Plan sent a resolution letter to the member indicating a 
change of PCP; however, the Plan did not ensure that the member is offered 
a PCP appointment within ten business days.  
• On 10/17/ 2022, a member filed a grievance stating that a specialist did not 
have an appointment until January 2023. The Plan confirmed with the

 14 of 21 specialist office that appointments  are unavailable until January 2023. On 
11/21/ 2022, the Plan sent a resolution letter to member indicating that the 
member should contact the PCP to request another Neurologist; however, the 
Plan did not ensure that the member is offered a specialist appointment within 
15 business days.  
During the interview, the Plan stated that it continuously monitors appointment wait 
times through grievances but did not ensure providers offer member appointment s with 
a PCP within 10 business days of the request  and a specialist within 15 business days 
of the request as specified in the Plan Policy , CA_PNXX_033 . 
 The Plan cannot ensure providers meet the timely appointment requirements if it does not ensure or review appointments received by members. Non -compliance in access  to 
timely appointments with a PCP within  10 business days of the request  and a specialist 
within 15 business days can result in compromised health or preventable com plications.  
 Recommendation: Implement procedures to ensure providers offer member 
appointment s with a PCP within 10 business days and a specialist within 15 business 
days of the request.

NON- EMERGENCY MEDICAL TRANSPORTATION 
NON- MEDICAL  TRANSPORTATION 
 3.8.1 Physician Certification Statement  (PCS)  Form for NEMT Services  
 The Plan is required to comply with all existing final Policy Letters and APLs issued by DHCS. (Contract, Exhibit E, Attachment 2(1)(D))  
 The Plan is required to use a DHCS -approved PCS form to determine the appropriate 
level of service for Medi -Cal members. The member must have an approved PCS form 
authorizing NEMT by the provider. The Plan is required to provide authorization for NEMT for the duration of the recurring appointments, not to exceed 12 months and the Plan cannot modify the authorization. The Plan must ensure that a copy of the PCS form is on file for all members receiving NEMT services and that all fields are filled out by the provider. (APL 22 -008, Non- Emergency Medical and Non- Medical Transportation 
Services and Related Travel Expenses)  
 Plan Policy , CA_OPXX_003 – Transportation Benefits –  CA (revised date: 04/12/2023) , 
stated the PCS is required for all non- urgent, routine tr ips. Upon receipt of a trip 
request, ModivCare submits the form (via fax) to the member s’ physician or physician 
extender. ModivCare will make two attempts to obtain the PCS form. After the two attempts the non- responsive provider is added to the weekly Pending PCS Form 
Report. The Plan will then engage the non- responsive provider or delegated group the 
member is assigned to request that the PCS form be returned. Effective May 1, 2023, 
ModivCare will deny all non- urgent NEMT requests if a valid PCS form is not on file.  
 Finding: The Plan did not ensure PCS forms were on file to authorize NEMT services for all members.  
 In a verification study, 5 of 25 NEMT trips did not have the required PCS forms on file 
for the service trip date.  
 Plan Policy , CA_OPXX_003 , indicated the Plan ’s transportation vendor ModivCare is 
initially required to obtain the PCS forms from the providers. ModivCare will attempt two calls to providers to obtain the PCS forms. If unsuccessful, the non- responsive provider 
will be added to the weekly Pending PCS Fo rm Report that is then submitted to the Plan 
for further PCS requests. During the interview, the Plan confirmed that ModivCare 
needed to add members without PCS form s to the weekly P ending PCS Report. 
However, ModivCare actually did not include the non- responsive providers in  the weekly 
Pending PCS R eport for the following examples:

 16 of 21 • For a physical therapy trip provided on 0 8/24/2023, there was no PCS form on 
file. The first attempt to request the PCS form was made on 0 8/11/ 2023,  and the 
second request on 0 8/24/2023.  
• For a pain management trip provided on 0 7/07/2023, there was no PCS form on 
file. Of note, the first a nd second attempts to request the PCS form were made 
on 02/01/2023.  
• For a Methadone treatment trip provided on 07/17/2023, there was no PCS form 
on file. The first attempt to request the PCS form was made on 03/02/2022,  and 
the second request on 0 8/16/2022.  
 Without obtaining PCS forms for NEMT trips, the Plan is unable to determine the appropriate level of service for Medi -Cal members.  
 Recommendation:  Revise and implement policies and procedures to ensure PCS 
forms are on file to authorize NEMT services for all members.

CATEGORY 4 – MEMBERS’ RIGHTS  
 
 
4.1  
GRIEVANCE SYSTEM  
 
 4.1.1  Grievance Resolution Letter s 
 The Plan is required to implement and maintain a Member Grievance System in accordance with the CCR, Title 22, section 53858 and CCR, Title 28, section 1300.68. 
(Contract, Exhibit A, Attachment 14(1))  
 Timeframes for resolving grievances and sending written resolution to the member are delineated in federal and state law. The S tate’s established timeframe is 30 calendar 
days. Managed Care Plans  must comply with the state ’s established timeframe of 30 
calendar days for grievance resolution. ( APL 21 -011, Grievance and Appeal 
Requirements)  
 Plan Policy , CA_GAMC_015  Grievance Process: Member - CA (revised date: 
08/28/2023) , stated that the Plan has designated who will send grievance resolution 
letters to its Medi -Cal members within 30 calendar days of the receipt of the grievance.  
 Finding:  The Plan did not send resolution letters for quality of service grievances within 
the required 30 calendar days.  
 In a verification study of quality of service grievance cases, the resolution letters for 39 of 40 cases were not sent within the required 30 calendar days timeframe. The grievance resolution letters were sent between 38 to 61 days.  
 During the interview, the Plan stated that it  monitor s the timeliness of the grievance 
cases daily and monthly through its turnaround time dashboard.  The dashboard 
captures the daily and monthly percentages of grievance cases  as a whole that are 
completed timely or not.  However, even with this form of monitoring , the Plan still did  
not ensure all grievance cases were resolved within the required timeframe.  
 Untimely grievance resolution letters may lead to delayed patient care and may have an 
impact on clinical outcomes for the members.  
 This is a repeat of prior year finding 4.1.2 - Grievance Resolution Letters. 
 Recommendation:  Develop and implement a process to ensure quality of service 
grievance resolution letters are sent to members within required timeframes.

 The Plan is required to implement and maintain a Member Grievance System in accordance with CCR, Title 22, section 53858 and CCR, Title 28, Section 1300.68. 
(Contract, Exhibit A, Attachment 14(1))  
 The Plan is required to establish and maintain written procedures for submittal, processing, and resolution of all grievances. ( CCR, Title 28, section 53858(a))  
 “Resolved”  means that the grievance has reached a final conclusion with respect to the 
member s’ submitted grievance, and there are no pending member  appeals within the 
Plan’s grievance system, including entities with delegated authority. ( CCR, Title 28, 
section 1300.68(a)(4))  
 Plan Policy , CA_GAMC_015 Grievance Process: Member –  CA (revised date: 
08/28/2023 ), stated that the Plan has established, implemented, maintains and 
oversees a G rievance and A ppeal System to ensure receipt, review, and resolution of 
grievances and appeals, in accordance with the requirements in APL 21- 011, Grievance 
and Appeal Requirements . Members have the right to communicate dissatisfaction with 
any aspect of the Plan ’s Medi -Cal services for investigation and resolution in writing.  
 Finding: The Plan sent member resolution letters without completely resolving the 
members ’ quality of service grievances.  
 A quality of service grievance verification study revealed that in 6  of 25 cases the Plan 
did not fully address and resolve all issues in members ’ grievances.  
 During the interview, the Plan stated that its Grievance Analyst s are responsible for 
addressing and fully resolving the grievances. The Grievance Analyst sends  up to three 
requests for a response from the provider in order to render a written resolution to 
address and resolve the member s’ grievances.  However, the Plan could not 
substantiate that  all issues in members ’ grievances  were completely resolved. T he Plan 
lacked the procedures to adequately address  all grievances for the member. F or 
example:  
• In one case, the member filed  a grievance because the earliest appointment  
available was  three months later. During the investigation process, the analyst 
tried to help the member  get an earlier  appointment, but the steps taken w ere not 
documented in the file. The resolution letter  stated that the Plan confirm ed with 
the provider that there was no appointment sooner  than three months.  The Plan 
did not ensure or document whether  the member was able to have a timely 
appointment .

DATE OF AUDIT: November 27, 2023,  through December 8, 2023  
 
 19 of 21 • In another  case, the member  filed a grievance in No vember 2022,  because she 
could not get a doctor ’s visit until January 2023. The Plan confirmed with the 
provider that no appointment was  available until January 2023. The resolution 
letter stated that a PCP change was made for the member , and the Plan urged 
member to call the new PCP for any appointment. The Plan did not ensure that 
the member was able to mak e a timely appointment.  
 Incom plete resolution of member grievances may result in missed opportunities for 
improved health care delivery and poor health outcomes for members.  
 Recommendation:  Revise and implement policy and procedure to ensure member 
grievances are completely resolved.  
  4.1.3  Plan ’s Resolution of Quality of Care Grievances  
 The Plan shall provide a notice of grievance resolution to the member as quickly as the 
member s’ health condition requires, within 30 calendar days from the date Plan 
receives the grievance. (Contract, Exhibit A, Attachment 14 (1)(B) ) 
 The Plan shall implement and have in place a M ember Grievance System in 
accordance with CCR, Title 28 , section 1300.68 (Contract, Exhibit A, Attachment 14 (1)) 
  
“Resolved”  means that the grievance has reached a final conclusion with respect to the 
member s’ submitted grievance. If the Plan has multiple internal levels of grievance 
resolution, all levels must be completed within 30 calendar  days of the Plan ’s receipt of 
the gr ievance.  (CCR, Title 28, section 1300.68 (4a))  
 The Plan’s written resolution must contain a clear and concise explanation of the Plan ’s 
decision. (APL 21 -011, Grievance and Appeal Requirements, Notice and “ Your Rights ” 
Templates)  
 Plan Policy , CA_GAMC_015 Grievance Process : Member -  CA (revised date: 
08/28/2023 ), stated all clinical grievances are assigned to Grievance and Appeal  
Clinical Associates for review and appropriate action. If the clinical situation is not 
urgent, the grievance or problem is resolved within 30 calendar days of receipt of the grievance.  
 Finding: The Plan did not resolve quality of care grievances within 30 days of  receipt of 
the grievance.

DATE OF AUDIT: November 27, 2023,  through December 8, 2023  
 
 20 of 21 In a verification study, two quality of care grievances  did not have grievance resolution 
within the required 30- day time frame.  These two grievances were eventually classified 
as high severity PQI cases.  
 Although t he grievance resolution letters  in these two cases were sent within 30 days, 
the letters  did not provide the member s with any specific information on the status of the 
Plan’s decision on the validity of the grievance.  For example:  
• One sample involved a four  month delay in needed pain management for an 
urgent radiologically proven injury. The grievance resolution letter  was sent within 
30 days but did not provide the member with any specific information on the status of the Plan ’s decision on the validity of the grievance.  
• The second sample involved a two and a half  month delay in the required 
physical therapy post -knee surgery to optimize patient outcomes. The grievance 
resolution letter was sent within 30 days but again did not provide the member with any specific information on the status of the Plan ’s decision on the validity of 
the grievance.  
The Plan’s grievance resolution letters did not clearly and concisely explain the 
grievance decision as required by APL 21- 011.  
If the Plan does not provide timely grievance resolution for  quality  of care grievances , it 
can lead to delayed resolution and missed serv ices, resulting in poor health outcomes.  
 Recommendation: Revise and implement policies and procedures to ensure that all 
quality of care grievances are resolved timely.  
  
4.1.4  Medical Director Review of Quality of Care Grievance 
 The Plan shall maintain a M edical Director whose responsibilities shall include resolving 
grievances related to the medical quality of care. ( Contract,  Exhibit A,  Attachment 
1(6)(E))  
 The Plan shall implement and maintain p rocedures to ensure every grievance s ubmitted 
is reported to the appropriate level and participation of individuals with authority  to 
require corrective action.  Grievances related to medical quality  of care issues shall be 
referred to a Medical Director. (Contract, Exhibit A, Attachment 14(2)(C)(D))  
 Plan Policy , GAMC 15 Grievance Process Members  (revised date 08/28/2023) , states 
that “all grievances related to the medical quality of care issues are immediately 
submitted to the Plan’ s Medical Director for action.” It outlines the process : “Clinical 
grievances are assigned to Grievance and Appeals  Clinical Associates for review and 
appropriate action. If there is evidence of a quality of care concern, the Grievance and Appeals  Clinical Associate will create a PQI and send it to the Medical Director .”

AUDIT PERIOD: October 1, 2022 , through October 31, 2023  
DATE OF AUDIT: November 27, 2023,  through December 8, 2023  
 
 21 of 21 Finding: The Plan did not refer all quality of care grievances to the M edical Director for 
resolution.  
 In verification study samples, all 13 quality of care grievances, rated zero or one, did not 
have documented M edical Director review prior to resolution. Notably, all the resolution 
letters were signed by nurses who reviewed the quality of care grievance.  
 During the interview, the Plan explained that a nurs e initially reviews the quality of care 
grievances and will recommend a severity level before sending it to a M edical Director 
for final review. If the recommended severity level is two or higher, a PQI will be opened. However, the Plan could not substanti ate that a M edical Director reviewed or 
took action on the grievances.   The Plan’s policy requires but does not ensure that the Medical Director reviews all 
quality of care grievances.  
 If a M edical Director does not adjudicate quality of care grievances, important clinical 
issues may be missed, ultimately affecting health care,  and resulting in poor outcomes.  
 Recommendation: Revise and implement policies and procedures that ensure all 
quality of care grievances are referred to a Medical Director for resolution.
