 II. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
  This report presents the findings of the Department of Health Care Services (DHCS) 
medical audit of the Plan for  the period November  1, 2021  through October 31, 2022. 
The audit  was conducted from February  6, 2023  through February  17, 2023 . The audit 
consisted of document review, verification studies, and interviews with Plan personnel.   
 An Exit Conference was held on March 29, 2023. The Plan was allowed 15 calendar days from the date of the Exit Conference to address the preliminary audit repo rt. 
 The audit evaluated six categories of performance: u tilization management , case 
management and coordination of care, access and a vailability of care, member’s rights, 
quality management, and a dministrative and o rganizational capacity.  
 The prior DHCS medical audit report  issued on June 28, 2022,  (audit period November 
1, 2019 through October 31, 2021) identified deficiencies incorporated in the Corrective 
Action Plan (CAP).  The prior year CAP was not completely closed at the time of onsite; 
however, this year’s audit included review of documents to determine the 
implementation and effectiveness of the Plan’s corrective actions.  
 The summary of findings  follows:  
 Category 1 –  Utilization Management  
 Audit of category one yielded no findings . 
 Category 2 –  Case Management and Coordination of Care  
 Audit of category two yielded no findings . 
Category 3 –  Access and Availability of Care  
Audit of category three yielded no findings . 
 During the prior audit, t he Plan did not ensure transportation providers were enrolled in 
the Medi -Cal program. Although t he prior year CAP was not closed for this finding,  the 
Plan updated procedures to ensure new transportation providers were enrolled in the Medi -Cal program and
 is currently working with the Managed Care Q uality and Monitoring 
Division  to correct the prior deficiency .

procedures, trained staff on the new grievance process , and implemented oversight to 
ensure the appropriate classification of member grievances . Review of the Plan’s 
response to the CAP yielded no findings.  
 During the prior audit, t he Plan did not submit a complete DHCS Privacy Incident Report  
(PIR)  to the DHCS Program Contract Manager, DHCS Privacy Officer, and DH CS 
Information Security Officer.  The Plan revised  and implemented new instructions to 
ensure the submission of a complete PIR to all DHCS entities.  Review of the Plan’s 
response to the CAP yielded no findings.  
 Category 5 –  Quality Management  
 Audit of category five yielded no findings . 
 During the prior audit, t he Plan did not conduct new provider training for all newly 
contracted providers within ten working days . The Plan revised policies and integrated a
