  COMPLIANCE AUDIT FINDINGS (CAF)  
 
PLAN: Santa Barbara San Luis Obispo Regional Health Authority dba CenCal Health  
 
AUDIT PERIOD: October  1, 2022  through September 30, 2023  
DATES  OF AUDIT: October 9, 202 3 through October 19, 2023  
 
 2 of 2 STATE SUPPORTED SERVICES  
 The Plan is required to provide, or arrange to provide, to eligible members State Supported Services, which include abortion and abortion- related services. (State 
Supported Services Contract, Exhibit A(1))  
 The Plan’s policy CLM -09, State Supported Services/Pregnancy Termination/Abortion 
(revised August 9, 2023 ), states that members can access abortion services in and out 
of network without prior authorization.  The Plan defines abortion services as a “sensitive 
service” and assures members’  confidentiality and accessibility.  Non-emergency 
inpatient hospitalization for the performance of an abortion requires prior authorization under the same criteria as other medical procedures.   The Member Handbook informs members that some providers may have a moral objection to abortion and have a right not to offer this  service. However, members can 
contact the Plan  for assistance. Members are also informed that referrals are not 
needed from primary care physicians for abortion and abortion- related services.   
 The Provider Manual informs providers of the members’ freedom of choice in obtaining sensitive services, such as abortion services, without prior authorization.   The audit found no discrepancies in this section.  
 Recommendation:  None.
