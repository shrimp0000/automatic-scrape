  RE:  Department of Health Care Services Medical Audit     
 
 
Dear Ms. Oduro : 
 The Department of Health Care Services (DHCS), Audits and Investigations Division conducted an on-site Medical Audit of Inland Empire Health Plan, a Managed Care Plan (MCP), from September 18, 2023  through September 29, 2023. The audit covered the 
period from  August 1, 2022, through July 31, 2023. 
  
The items were evaluated, and DHCS accepted the MCP’s submitted Corrective Action 
Plan (CAP). The CAP is hereby closed. The enclosed documents will serve as DHCS’ final response to the MCP’s CAP. Closure of this CAP does not halt any other processes in place between DHCS and the MCP regarding the d eficiencies in the audit report or 
elsewhere, nor does it preclude the DHCS from taking additional actions it deems necessary regarding these deficiencies.  
 Please be advised that in accordance with Health & Safety Code Section 1380(h) and the Public Recor ds Act, the final audit report and final CAP remediation document (final 
Attachment A) will be made available on the DHCS website and to the public upon request.  
  
If you have any questions, please reach out to CAP Compliance personnel.  
 Sincerely,  
 
  [Signa ture on file]

MCPs are required to provide a C orrective Action Plan (C AP) and respond to all documented deficiencies  included in  the medical audit report within 30 calendar 
days unless an alternative timeframe is indicated in the CAP Request letter.  MCPs are required to submit the CAP in Word format , which will reduce the turnaround 
time for DHCS to complete its review. According to ADA requirements , the document should be at least 12 pt.  
 
The CAP submission must include a written statement identifying the deficiency and describing the plan of action taken to correct the deficiency, as well as the 
operational results of that action.  The MCP shall directly address each deficiency component by completing the following columns provided for MCP res ponse: 1. 
Finding  Number and Summary , 2. Action Taken, 3. Supporting  Documentation, and 4. Completion/Expected Completion Date. The MCP must  include a project 
timeline with milestones in a separate document for each finding. Supporting documentation should accompany each Action Taken. If supporting documentation 
is missing, the MCP submission will not be accepted.  For policies and other documentation tha t have been revised, please highlight the new relevant text and 
include additional details, such as the title of the document, page number, revision date, etc.,  in the column “Supporting Documentation” to assist DHCS in 
identifying any updates that were made by the plan. Implementing deficiencies requiring short -term corrective action  should be completed within 30 calendar 
days. For deficiencies that may be reasonably determined to require long-term corrective action for a period longer than 30 days to reme dy or operationalize 
completely , the MCP is to indicate that it has initiated remedial action and is on the way toward  achieving an acceptable level of compliance. In those instances, the 
MCP must include the date when full compliance will be completed in addition to the above steps. Policies and procedures submitted during the CAP process must 
still be sent to the MCP’s Contract Manager for review and approval, as applicable , according to  existing requirements.  
 Please note that DHCS expects the plan to ta ke swift action to implement improvement interventions as proposed in the CAP; therefore, DHCS 
encourages all remediation efforts to be in place no later than month 6 of the CAP unless DHCS grants prior approval for an extended implementation 
effort . 
 DHCS will communicate closely with the MCP throughout the CAP process and provide technical assistance to confirm that the MCP offers sufficient documentation to correct deficiencies. Depending on the number  and complexity of deficiencies identified, DHCS may require the MCP to provide weekly updates.
