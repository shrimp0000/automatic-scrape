I. INTRODUCTION  
Background  
In accordance with California Welfare and Institutions Code section 14456, the Department of Health Care Services (DHCS) may conduct additional reviews outside of the annual medical audit when DHCS determines there is good cause.  DHCS directed the Contract and Enrollment Review Division to conduct focused audits of all contracting Medi-Cal Managed Care Plans (Plans) to evaluate current Plans’ performance in the areas of Behavioral Health and Transportation services.  
These focused audits differ from DHCS’ regular annual medical audits in scope and depth. The annual medical audits evaluate the Plan’s organizational structures, policies and procedures, and systems for compliance with contractual requirements. The focused  
audits examined the operational issues that may hinder appropriate and timely member access to medically necessary care. The focused audit engagement formally commenced in January 2023 through December 2023.                                                                     
For the Behavioral Health section, the focused audit evaluated the Plan’s monitoring activities of specific areas such as Specialty Mental Health Services (SMHS), Non -
Specialty Mental Health Services (NSMHS), and Substance Use Disorder Services (SUDS). The focused audit also reviewed potential issues that may contribute to the lack of 
member access and oversight for SMHS, NSMHS, and SUDS.  
The focused audit conducted a more in -depth look at current Plan operations/practices 
for executing the delivery of transportation services. The audit examined potential 
causes for the systemic issues surrounding the Non -Emergency Medical Transportation 
(NEMT) and Non-Medical Transportation (NMT) services, specifically when 
transportation is delegated to a transportation broker.  
Kaiser Foundation Health Plan, Inc. (KFHP) obtained its Knox -Keene license in November 
1977, and contracted with DHCS in 1994, as a Geographic Managed Care (GMC) plan to provide health care services to Medi -Cal members in the GMC counties of Sacramento 
and San Diego.  
In 2005, KP Cal, LLC (Plan) was created and licensed as a Knox-Keene Plan to hold Kaiser's GMC Contracts. DHCS then transferred the GMC Contracts to the Plan. The Plan and KFHP entered into a management and administrative services agreement to delegate adm inistrative and operational functions such as quality improvement, 
grievances, and appeals to KFHP. These two entities also entered into a health services agreement to provide health care services to Plan members through KFHP’s network of 
4 
 
providers and medical centers. KFHP offers a comprehensive health care delivery system including physicians, medical centers, hospitals, laboratories, and pharmacies.  KFHP divides its operations into Northern California and Southern California regions with corresponding responsibilities for the Sacramento and San Diego GMC Contracts. The Sacramento GMC service area includes Sacramento County and members in Amador, El Dorado, and Placer Counties who were either previously enrolled or family -
linked with Kaiser.  
During the audit period, the Plan delegated NMT services to MTM, a transportation broker.  
As of October 31, 2023, KFHP’s total direct GMC Contract membership was approximately 211,047. Medi -Cal membership composition was 141,468 for Sacramento 
GMC.

II. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
 This report presents the audit findings of DHCS’ focused audit for the period of November 1, 2022, through October 31, 2023. The audit was conducted from October 31, 2023, through November 9, 2023. The audit consisted of document review, surveys, verificat ion studies, and interviews and file reviews with Plan representatives.  
An Exit Conference with the Plan was held on July 9, 2024. The Plan was allowed 15 calendar days from the date of the Exit Conference to provide supplemental information addressing the draft audit report findings. The Plan submitted a response after the Exit Conference. The results of the evaluation of the Plan’s response are reflected in this report.  
The focused audit evaluated the areas of performance for Behavioral Health and Transportation services.  
The summary of findings by performance area follows:  
Performance Area: Behavioral Health 
Category 2 –  Case Management and Coordination of Care : 
• Specialty Mental Health Services

• Substance Use Disorder Services  
The Plan is required to arrange for member referrals to the county department responsible for substance use treatment, or other community resources when services are not available through counties, for members identified as requiring alcohol or Substance U se Disorder (SUD) treatment services. The Plan is required to make good 
faith efforts to confirm whether members receive referred treatments, document when and where these treatments were received, and any next steps following treatment. If a member does n ot receive referred treatments, the Plan must follow up with the member 
to understand barriers and make adjustments to the referrals, if warranted. The Plan did not make good faith efforts to confirm whether members received referred treatments for SUD, fa iled to document when and where the referred treatments were received, and 
to document any next steps following treatment. The Plan did not follow up with members who did not receive referred treatments to understand barriers and make subsequent adjustments to referrals.

The Plan is required to have processes in place to ensure door -to-door assistance is 
being provided for all members receiving NEMT services. The Plan did not have a process in place to ensure that door-to -door assistance was being provided for all 
members receiving NEMT services.  
The Plan is also responsible for monitoring and overseeing its transportation brokers to ensure that transportation brokers are complying with the requirements set forth in All -
Plan Letters (APL). The Plan must conduct monitoring activities no less than qu arterly. 
The Plan did not conduct monitoring activities to verify NEMT providers were providing door -to-door assistance for members receiving NEMT services and did not conduct 
monitoring activities for the no-show rates of NEMT and NMT providers.

III. SCOPE/ AUDIT PROCEDURES  
 
SCOPE  
This focused audit was conducted by the DHCS , Contract and Enrollment Review 
Division  to ascertain that the medical services provided to Plan members complied with 
federal and state laws, Medi -Cal regulations and guidelines, and the State Contract . 
PROCEDURE  
On November 3, 2022, DHCS informed Plan s that it will be conducting focused audits to 
assess performance in certain identified high -risk areas. The focused audit was 
concurrently scheduled with the annual medical audit of Plan s. The audit scope 
encompasse d the following sections:  
• Behavioral Health  – SMHS, NSMHS, and SUDS 
• Transportation – NEMT and NMT services  
The audit was conducted from October 31, 2023, through November 9, 2023. The audit included a review of the Plan’s policies for providing services, the procedures used to implement the policies, and verification studies of the implementation and effectiven ess 
of the policies. Documents were reviewed and interviews were conducted with Plan administrators and staff.  
The following verification studies were conducted:  
Category 2 –  Case Management and Coordination of Care  
SMHS: Five cases were reviewed to evaluate whether there was member care 
coordination between the Plan, the county Mental Health Plan (MHP), and compliance with APL requirements.   
NSMHS: Five samples were reviewed to evaluate compliance with APL requirements.   
SUDS: The Plan was not able to provide DHCS with a report of referred members.  
Category 3 –  Access and Availability of Care  
NEMT: Five samples were reviewed to evaluate compliance with APL requirements.  
NMT: Five samples were reviewed to evaluate compliance with APL requirements.  
A description of the findings for each category is contained in the following report.

COMPLIANCE AUDIT FINDINGS  
Performance Area: Behavioral Health – SMHS, NSMHS, and 
SUDS 
Category 2 – Case  Management  and Coordination of Care  
 
2.1 Confirmation of Referred Treatments for Substance Use Disorder 
The Plan shall comply with all existing final Policy Letters and APLs issued by DHCS. (Contract, Exhibit E, Attachment 2(1)(D))  
The Plan is required to arrange for member referrals to the county department responsible for substance use treatment, or other community resources when services are not available through counties, for members identified as requiring alcohol or SUD treatme nt services. If treatment slots are not available in the county alcohol and SUD 
treatment programs within the Plan’s service area, the Plan must pursue placement outside the area. The Plan is required to make good faith efforts to confirm whether members r eceive referred treatments, document when and where the services are 
received, and any next steps following treatment.  (APL 21-014 Alcohol and Drug 
Screening, Assessment, Brief Interventions, and Referral to Treatment)  
Plan policy  Alcohol and Drug Screening, Assessment, Brief Intervention, and Referral to 
Treatment (approved May 8, 2023)  states that the Plan will make good faith efforts to 
confirm whether Medi -Cal members receive referred treatments and document when, 
where, and any next steps following treatment.  
Finding: The Plan did not make good faith efforts to confirm whether members received 
referred treatments for SUD and did not document when and where the services were received, as well as any next steps following treatment.   
Although Plan policy Alcohol and Drug Screening, Assessment, Brief Intervention, and Referral to Treatment states that the Plan would make good faith efforts to confirm 
members received referred treatments, the Plan did not follow this policy and procedure.  
In a written response, the Plan stated that it does not maintain a tracking or referral log for SUD referrals because SUD is carved out of the Plan contract. The Plan did not send official referrals to the county. The members requiring SUD services were us ually 
provided information about county services, and in some instances, there may have 
9 
 
been an attempt by the Plan staff to warmly hand-off or transfer the member to the county MHP line while on the phone.  
As part of the focused audit review, the Department requested a report of all members who received SUDS during the audit period in order to select a sample of members for a standard verification study. The Plan was not able to produce and provide a report or any other documentation of members who were referred for SUDS during the audit period. Given the Plan’s lack of knowledge, it could not demonstrate it made a good faith effort to confirm whether members received referred services, it could not validate it maintained documentation for when and where services were received, and any next steps following treatment.  If the Plan does not make an effort to confirm whether members received referred treatments, then members may miss opportunities to improve their health which could result in negative health outcomes.  Recommendation : Revise policies and procedures to ensure that the Plan makes a 
good faith effort to confirm whether members received referred treatments and document when and where the treatments are received, as well as any next steps following treatment . 
 
2.2 Follow Up for Referred Substance Use Disorder Treatments 
The Plan is required to arrange for member referrals to the county department responsible for substance use treatment, or other community resources when services are not available through counties, for members identified as requiring alcohol or SUD treatme nt services. If treatment slots are not available in the county alcohol and SUD 
treatment programs within the Plan’s service area, the Plan must pursue placement outside the area. If a member does not receive referred treatments, the Plan must follow up wi th the member to understand barriers and make adjustments to the referrals, if 
warranted.  The Plan must also attempt to connect with the provider to whom the 
member was referred to facilitate a warm handoff to necessary treatment. (APL 21-014 : 
Alcohol and Drug Screening, Assessment, Brief Interventions,  and Referral to Treatment)  
Plan policy  Alcohol and Drug Screening, Assessment, Brief Intervention, and Referral to 
Treatment  (approved May 8, 2023) states that if a member does not receive referred 
treatments, the Plan will follow up with the member to understand barriers and make adjustments to the referrals, if needed. The Plan will also attempt to connect with the provider to whom the member was referred to facili tate a warm handoff to necessary 
treatment.  
10 
 
Finding : The Plan did not follow up with members who did not receive referred 
treatments to understand barriers and make subsequent adjustments to referrals.  
Although Plan policy Alcohol and Drug Screening, Assessment, Brief Intervention, and Referral to Treatment  (approved May 8, 2023) states that the Plan would follow up with 
the Medi -Cal members to understand barriers and make adjustments to the referrals if 
needed, the Plan did not follow this policy and procedure.  
In a written response, the Plan stated that it does not maintain a tracking or referral log for SUD referrals because SUD is carved out of the Plan contract. The Plan does not send official SUD referrals to the county. The members requiring SUDS were usual ly provided 
information about county services, and in some instances, there may have been an attempt by Plan staff to warmly hand-off or transfer the member to the county MHP line while on the phone.  
As part of the focused audit review, the Department requested a report of all members who received SUDS during the audit period to select a sample of members for a standard verification study. The Plan was not able to produce and provide a report or any ot her documentation of members who were referred for SUDS during the audit 
period. Given the Plan’s lack of knowledge, it could not validate it followed up with members who did not receive referred treatments to understand barriers and make subsequent adjustments.   
If the Plan does not follow up with members who did not receive referred treatments, then members may miss opportunities to improve their health, which could result in negative health outcomes and member harm.  Recommendation : Revise and implement policies and procedures to ensure the Plan 
awareness of members who did not receive referred treatments to understand barriers and make subsequent adjustment to referrals as well as follow up with members who do not receive referred treatments.

COMPLIANCE AUDIT FINDINGS  
Performance Area: Transportation – NEMT and NMT  
Category 3 –  Access and Availability of Care  
 
3.1 Door -to-Door Assistance 
The Plan is required to have processes in place to ensure door -to-door assistance is 
being provided for all members receiving NEMT services. ( APL 22 -008 Non -Emergency 
Medical and Non-Medical Transportation Services and Related Travel Expenses ) 
Plan policy  NCAL Regional Medi -Cal Transportation  (revised 10/06/22) states that the 
Plan ensures that door -to-door assistance is being provided for all members receiving 
NEMT services.  Finding: The Plan did not have a process in place to ensure door -to-door assistance 
was being provided for all members receiving NEMT services.  
The Plan policy did not explain how the Plan ensures door -to-door assistance is being 
provided for all members receiving NEMT services.   
A verification study of five NEMT samples revealed two NEMT trips were completed and three were cancelled. Door-to -door assistance was not documented by the 
transportation providers for the two completed trips.  
During the interviews, the Plan stated all transportation providers were required to provide door -to-door assistance and that it ensured door -to-door assistance was being 
provided through daily complaints and grievances within the Member Services system. The Plan stated that time stamps indicated door -to-door service were provided; 
however, the Plan did not explain how time stamps indicate actual delivery of door -to-
door assistance.   
In response to the DHCS Survey, the Plan stated it monitored door -to-door on-time 
performance through monthly Vehicle Response Performance reports that showed transportation providers’ on -time performance for NEMT services. However, the reports 
did not inc lude any verification of door -to-door assistance.  
The Plan has eight NEMT network providers for the Northern California region. Seven signed contracts include a provision requiring door -to-door assistance. The contracts 
state: “All transports shall be door -to-door service from pickup and drop-off location s.” 
Review of the other contract identified the following:  
12 
 
• One contract is not signed and does not include any provisions requiring door -
to-door assistance.  
If the Plan does not ensure door -to-door assistance is provided, then members who do 
not receive the required assistance, may be at risk of sustaining an injury and causing harm to themselves.  
Recommendation: Revise and implement policies and procedures to have a process in 
place to ensure door- to-door assistance is provided for all members receiving NEMT 
services.  
 
3.2 Monitoring of Door -to-Door Assistance  
The Plan is responsible for monitoring and overseeing their network providers and subcontractors and ensuring compliance with all applicable contract requirements, including APLs.  The Plan must conduct monitoring activities no less than quarterly. 
Monitoring activities may include but are not limited to verification that the NEMT provider is providing door -to-door assistance for members receiving NEMT services. 
(APL 22 -008 Non -Emergency Medical and Non-Medical Transportation Services and 
Related Travel Expenses )  
Plan policy  NCAL Regional Medi -Cal Transportation  (revised 10/06/22) states that the 
Plan is responsible for monitoring and overseeing its transportation brokers. Monitoring activities are conducted no less than quarterly and may include verification that the NEMT provider is providing door-to -door assistance for members receiving NEMT 
services.  
Finding: The Plan did not monitor or oversee its network transportation providers.  The 
Plan did not have monitoring activities to ensure network providers were providing door -to-door assistance for members receiving NEMT services.  
The Plan’s policy did not include language for monitoring and overseeing network transportation providers. The language in the policy only included monitoring transportation brokers.  A verification study of five NEMT samples revealed two completed trips and three 
cancelled trips. Door -to-door assistance was not documented by the NEMT provider for 
the two completed trips.   
During the interviews, the Plan stated all transportation vendors were required to provide door -to-door assistance and it ensured door -to-door assistance was being 
13 
 
provided through daily complaints and grievances within the Member Services system.  
The Plan stated that time stamps indicate door -to-door service was provided; however, 
the Plan did not explain how time stamps indicate actual delivery of door -to-door 
assistance.  The Plan did not provide any other documentation demonstrating that it 
monitors the provision of door -to-door assistance.  
In response to the DHCS Survey, the Plan stated it monitored door -to-door on-time 
performance through monthly Vehicle Response Performance reports that showed transportation providers’ on -time performance for NEMT services. However, the reports 
did not inc lude any verification of NEMT door -to-door assistance.  
The Plan has eight NEMT network providers for the Northern California region. Seven signed contracts include a provision requiring door -to-door assistance. The contracts 
state, “All transports shall be door -to-door service from pickup and drop-off location s.” 
Review of the other contract identified the following:  
• One contract is not signed and does not include a provision requiring door -
to-door assistance.  
If the Plan does not have a process in place for monitoring and overseeing network providers, including monitoring that door -to-door assistance is being provided by 
network providers, then members who do not receive the required assistance, may be at risk of sustaining an injury and causing harm to themselves.  
Recommendation: Revise and implement policies and procedures to ensure that the 
Plan is responsible for monitoring and overseeing their network transportation providers, including, but not limited to, having monitoring activities to ensure network providers are providing door -to-door assistance for members receiving NEMT services.  
 
3.3 Monitoring of the Transportation Network Provider No Show Rates 
The Plan is responsible for ensuring that their network providers comply with all applicable state and federal laws and regulations, contract requirements, and other DHCS guidance, including APLs and Policy Letters. The Plan must conduct monitoring activit ies no less than quarterly. Monitoring activities may include, but are not limited to, 
verification of the no show rates for NEMT and NMT  providers. (APL 22-008 Non -
Emergency Medical and Non-Medical Transportation Services and Related Travel Expenses)  
Plan policy NCAL Regional Medi -Cal Transportation  (revised October 6, 2022), states the 
Plan conducts monitoring activities no less than quarterly. Monitoring activities may 
14 
 
include but are not limited to verification of the no-show rate for NEMT and NMT providers.  
Finding: The Plan did not conduct monitoring activities for the no -show rates of NEMT 
and NMT transportation providers.  
During the interview, the Plan stated the dispatch team would have notes on no -show 
trips. The Plan stated for no -shows or cancelled trips, it worked on replacing the 
provider.  
If the Plan is unable to find another provider, the Regional Medical Transportation Department would contact the facility to see if the member can be seen later and will request the member to reschedule their appointment. I f that is not possible, then the 
Plan stated it encouraged the member to file a grievance and Member Services Department is copied on that response. The effort to find another vendor is 
documented in the vendor care system.  
In written statements, the Plan explained it did not actively monitor no -show rates for 
NEMT and NMT services. The Plan stated it leveraged DHCS recommendations included in APL 22 -008.  
Without adequate monitoring of transportation providers’ no -show rates, members may 
experience barriers to accessing health care. In addition, members may experience missed quality improvement opportunities.  
Recommendation: Develop and implement policies and procedures to ensure that the 
Plan conducts monitoring activities for the no -show rates of NEMT and NMT providers.
