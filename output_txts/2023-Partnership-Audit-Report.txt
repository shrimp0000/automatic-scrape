 I. INTRODUCTION  
 
 
Partnership Health Plan of California (Plan) is a non-profit community-based health care 
organization. The Plan is governed by a Board of Commissioners comprised of locally 
elected officials, provider representatives, and patient advocates. The Plan is a County 
Organized Health System (COHS) managed care model endorsed by the County 
Boards of Supervisors.  
 
The Plan began operations in 1994, serving Solano County and has expanded to 14 
Northern California counties: Del Norte, Humboldt, Lassen, Lake, Marin, Mendocino, 
Modoc, Napa, Shasta, Siskiyou, Sonoma, Solano, Trinity, and Yolo. Plan members 
account for 31 percent of all residents in the 14 county service area. 
 
As of June 2023, the Plan had approximately 698,404 Medi-Cal members. Medi-Cal 
members are distributed as follow: Del Norte 13,065, Humboldt 62,667, Lassen 9,228, 
Lake 36,038, Marin 52,603, Mendocino 42,681, Modoc 4,287, Napa 36,117, Shasta 
73,712, Siskiyou 19,836, Sonoma 135,705, Solano 142,226, Trinity 5,900, and Yolo 
64,339.

 II. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
 
 
This report presents the audit findings of the Department of Health Care Services 
(DHCS) medical audit for the period July 1, 2022, through June 30, 2023. The audit was 
conducted from December 4, 2023, through December 15, 2023. The audit consisted of 
document reviews, verification studies, and interviews with Plan representatives.   
 
An Exit Conference was held on March 1, 2024. The Plan was allowed 15 calendar 
days from the date of the Exit Conference to provide supplemental information to 
address the preliminary audit findings. On March 13, 2024, the Plan submitted a 
response to address the audit findings. The results of the DHCS evaluation of the Plan’s 
response are reflected in this report.  
 
The audit evaluated six categories of performance: Utilization Management, Case 
Management and Coordination of Care, Access and Availability of Care, Member’s 
Rights, Quality Management, and Administrative and Organizational Capacity. 
 
The prior DHCS medical audit report was issued on April 5, 2023.  
 
The summary of findings follows: 
 
Category 1 – Utilization Management 
 
Review of Prior Authorization (PA) and appeal requests for appropriate and timely 
adjudication yielded no findings. 
 
Category 2 – Case Management and Coordination of Care 
 
Review of the Plan’s Case Management and Coordination of Care yielded no findings.  
 
Category 3 – Access and Availability of Care 
 
Review of the Plan’s Access and Availability of Care yielded no findings.  
 
Category 4 – Member’s Rights  
 
If the Plan has multiple levels of grievance resolution or appeal, all levels must be 
completed within 30 days of receiving the grievance. The Plan did not complete all 
levels of grievance resolution or appeal within 30 days of receipt.  
 
Category 5 – Quality Management 
 
The Plan is responsible for taking effective action to improve the Quality of Care (QOC) 
delivered by providers where deficiencies are identified. The Plan did not take effective 
 
3 of 10 
 action to improve deficient QOC issues to ensure professionally recognized standards 
of practice are delivered to members. 
 
Category 6 – Administrative and Organizational Capacity 
 
Review of the Plan’s organizational capacity to guard against fraud and abuse yielded 
no findings.

 CATEGORY 4 – MEMBER’S RIGHTS  
 
4.1 GRIEVANCE SYSTEM    
 
4.1.1 Grievance Resolution Timeframe 
 
The Plan shall have a system in accordance with California Code of Regulations (CCR), Title 
28, section 1300.68 and 1300.68.01; CCR, Title 22, section 53858; and Code of Federal 
Regulations, Title 42, section 438.402-424. The Plan shall follow grievance and appeal 
requirements. (Contract, Exhibit A, Attachment 14(1))  
 
The Plan shall provide a resolution notice to the member within 30 days from the date the Plan 
receives the grievance. (Contract, Exhibit A, Attachment 14(1)(B)) 
 
If the Plan has multiple levels of grievance resolution or appeal, all levels must be 
completed within 30-days of the Plan receiving the grievance. (CCR, Title 28, section 
1300.68(a)(4)(A)) 
 
Even though federal regulations allow for a 14-calendar day extension for standard and 
expedited appeals, this allowance does not apply to grievances. (All Plan Letter (APL) 21-
011, Grievance and Appeal Requirements, Notice and "Your Rights" Templates)  
 
The Plan’s policy, CGA024, Medi-Cal Member Grievance System (reviewed 9/14/22) , 
states that standard grievances are resolved within 30 days of the member’s grievance 
request. In the event a resolution cannot be completed within 30 days of the member’s 
request, the case may be eligible for a 14-day extension. A second level grievance is an 
appeal of a denied grievance and has a resolution timeframe of 30 days. This 30-day 
period is in addition to the 30-day timeframe for the initial grievance.  
 
Finding: The Plan did not complete all levels of grievance resolution or appeal within 30 
days of receiving the grievance. 
 
Plan policy, CGA024 states that a grievance may be eligible for a 14-day extension if a 
resolution cannot be completed within 30 days. The policy also states that a second level 
grievance is an appeal of a denied grievance and has a resolution timeframe of 30 days, 
which is in addition to the 30-day timeframe for the initial grievance. However, these 
provisions of the policy are contractually inaccurate. According to APL 21-011, the federal 
14 calendar day extension for standard appeals does not apply to grievances. Additionally, 
CCR, Title 28, section 1300.68, states if the Plan has multiple levels of grievance resolution 
or appeal, all levels must be completed within 30 days of receipt of the grievance.  
 
 COMPLIANCE AUDIT FINDINGS 
 
PLAN: Partnership Health Plan of California  
 
AUDIT PERIOD: July 1, 2022, through June 30, 2023  
DATES OF AUDIT: December 4, 2023, through December 15, 2023  
 
7 of 10 
 The verification study revealed that two QOC grievances were not resolved within 30 days 
of receipt. The following are examples of the deficiencies:   
 A member filed a grievance on 11/18/22, stating the neurologist was neglecting her and 
that she had an allergic reaction to a prescribed medication. The grievance resolution 
letter was sent 12/30/22, 42 days after receipt of the grievance. The second level 
grievance was filed 12/30/22. The grievance resolution letter for the second level 
grievance was sent 1/27/23. In total, 70 days elapsed after receipt of the initial 
grievance.  
 A member filed a grievance on 5/25/22, stating he was not able to arrange a timely 
follow-up with his provider and received an injection from an unqualified staff. The 
grievance resolution letter was sent 7/6/22, 42 days after receipt of the grievance. The 
second level grievance was filed 7/14/22. The grievance resolution letter for the second 
level grievance was sent 8/15/22. In total, 82 days elapsed after receipt of the initial 
grievance.  
 
In both verification study cases, the grievances were resolved based on the Plan’s policy 
provisions that did not adhere to regulatory requirements. Furthermore, the description of 
the second level grievance was carried over from the initial grievance. This demonstrates 
the second level grievances were a continuation of the initial grievances, not separate and 
distinct reviews after the initial grievances were resolved. Therefore, both grievances were 
not resolved within 30 days of receipt.  
 
During the interview, the Plan acknowledged their second level grievance process was 
introduced in May 2019, to align with the national accreditation standards. Nevertheless, 
the Plan was unable to confirm the process was thoroughly evaluated and vetted relative to 
the Medi-Cal Managed Care Contract prior to its implementation. Therefore, due to a lack 
of oversight, deficient policies and procedures were fully integrated into the grievance 
processing system.    
 
Adopting a grievance process that does not contractually conform to the standard 30 day 
timeframe can delay member's informed healthcare decisions. 
 
Recommendation: Revise and implement policies and procedures to ensure the 
grievance process with multiple levels of resolution or appeal are resolved within the 
required timeframe.

 CATEGORY 5 – QUALITY MANAGEMENT  
 
5.1 QUALITY IMPROVEMENT SYSTEM 
 
5.1.1 Quality Improvement System Oversight 
 
The Plan shall monitor, evaluate, and take effective action to address any needed 
improvements in the QOC delivered by all providers rendering services on its behalf, in any 
setting. (Contract Exhibit A, Attachment 4(1)) 
 
The Plan’s quality assurance program must be directed by providers and must document that 
the QOC provided is being reviewed and that problems are being identified. The Plan is also 
responsible to take effective action to improve care where deficiencies are identified, and that 
follow-up is planned where indicated. (CCR, Title 28, section 1300.70 (a)(1)) 
 
The Plan must continuously review the QOC provided to ensure that a level of care which 
meets professionally recognized standards of practice is being delivered to all members; and 
QOC problems are identified and corrected for all provider entities. (CCR, Title 28, section 
1300.70 (b)(1)(A) and (B)) 
 
The Plan’s policy, MPQP1053, Peer Review Committee (PRC) (review date 6/14/23),  states 
that the PRC will evaluate the quality concern related to the clinical care and determine 
whether there is sufficient evidence that the involved practitioner failed to provide care within 
generally accepted standards.  
 
The Plan’s policy, MPQP1016, Potential Quality Issue Investigation and Resolution (review 
date 06/14/23) , states that the Plan will level and score the severity of the PQI and may refer 
the PQI to the PRC. The PRC may recommend/implement a Corrective Action Plan (CAP), 
which is a plan approved by the PRC to help ensure that a related quality issue does not occur 
in the future.  
 
The Plan’s Quality Improvement Program Evaluation (July 2022, through June 2023), states 
that the Quality and Performance Improvement (QI/PI) program provides a systematic process 
to monitor and evaluate the quality of clinical care and health care service delivery to all Plan 
members. This includes an organized framework to implement strong interventions when 
opportunities for improvement are identified.

PLAN: Partnership Health Plan of California  
 
AUDIT PERIOD: July 1, 2022, through June 30, 2023  
DATES OF AUDIT: December 4, 2023, through December 15, 2023

 Finding: The Plan did not take effective action to improve deficient QOC issues to ensure 
professionally recognized standards of practice are delivered to members. 
 
The Plan’s QI/PI program provides systematic processes to monitor and evaluate the quality 
of clinical care and health care service delivery to Plan members, which includes a framework 
to implement strong interventions when opportunities for improvement are identified. The 
Plan’s PRC is responsible for reviewing PQIs referred to the committee and for recommending 
CAPs to remediate deficient QOC provided to members. However, despite having identified 
providers who delivered deficient QOC, the Plan confirmed there were no CAPs issued; only 
letters of concern were sent with no follow-up required prior to closure of the case. 
 
The verification study revealed that the Plan did not take effective action to appropriately 
address 14 out of 21 PQIs related to deficient QOC provided to members. For example: 
 A mother complained about the misdiagnosis and delay in treatment of her child with new- 
onset diabetes. The treating provider misdiagnosed type 1 diabetes mellitus as type 2 
diabetes mellitus and therefore, the child was sent home with the incorrect course of 
treatment plan. The child returned to the clinic and saw a different provider with continued 
clinical signs of untreated type 1 diabetes. The provider’s medical team again failed to 
properly manage the type 1 diabetes within accepted standards of care. These errors 
resulted in the child’s hospitalization for Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA) related to untreated 
type 1 diabetes. The Plan’s PRC reviewed the case and sent the clinics administration a 
letter of concern for failure to properly identify and differentiate between type 1 and type 2 
diabetes, and for failure to appropriately manage a pediatric patient presenting in DKA 
from untreated type 1 diabetes; no remedial education and/or the issuance of a CAP was 
sent to the clinics administration to remediate any future occurrences. 
 A newborn infant’s delivery was complicated by meconium and shoulder dystocia. 
Following a neonatologist’s consultation and instruction to initiate intubation, the following 
physicians failed to properly manage the airway of the newborn: a pediatrician, an 
emergency room physician, and an anesthesiologist. The Plan’s subject matter expert 
noted that a laryngeal mask airway was not used or available at the warmer bedside, 
which would have been the standard of care if unable to intubate the baby. The PRC only 
recommended to send a letter of concern to the hospital administration; no remedial 
education was sent to the treating providers to ensure that a similar incident of inadequate 
care would not happen again. 
 
During the interview, the Plan confirmed their PRC has the responsibility for recommending 
and implementing CAPs on providers who deliver deficient QOC. The Plan acknowledged that 
only templated letters of concern directed by the PRC were sent to providers outlining the 
QOC lapses. The Plan stated that these letters have not been updated for many years and 
agreed that more definitive language could have been included to address the providers

 knowledge gaps and to remediate their QOC concerns. Furthermore, the Plan’s PRC minutes 
noted that no follow-up action was required in these cases. 
  
When the Plan does not recommend strong interventions to improve deficient QOC related 
issues, the Plan’s members are at risk to repeated incidences of poor QOC in the future. 
 
Recommendation:  Implement Plan policies and procedures to ensure strong corrective 
actions are enacted to improve QOC delivered to Plan members.

STATE SUPPORTED SERVICES 
 
The Plan is required to provide, or arrange to provide, to eligible members the following 
State Supported Services: Current Procedural Terminology Codes 59840 through 
59857 and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Common Procedure 
Coding System Codes: X1516, X1518, X7724, X7726, and Z0336. These codes are 
subject to change upon the Department of Health Care Services implementation of the 
Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 electronic transaction and 
code sets provisions. (State Supported Services Contract, Exhibit A, (4))  
 
The Plan’s policy, MCCL-02 Family Planning Services (review date 03/01/2023) , states 
that family planning services include abortion services and the supplies that are 
incidental or preliminary to the abortion. Without parental consent, the Plan allows 
abortion services for minors and will help any member find a provider if a hospital, clinic, 
or other provider refuses to provide the service. Additionally, the Plan is responsible for 
paying all family planning services except for members assigned to Kaiser Permanente. 
 
The verification study revealed that the Plan appropriately processed, paid, or denied  
abortion service claims within the required timeframes.  
 
Based on the review of the Plan’s documents, there were no significant deficiencies 
noted for the audit period. 
 
Recommendation: None.
